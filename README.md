## What is this?
This is a tool to run some ML subroutines from the command line. I'm primarly using this as a learning experience for C++ and how to optimize the implementation of ML algorithms.

I'm also curious about certain ways to parallelize training machine learning algorithms, and hopefully developing them in a systems-heavy language like C++ will allow me to explore this.

## Instructions to Run on Ubuntu
- Install the Eigen libary for linear algebra
- Run `make` in the root directory, and then call `ml-cli`
